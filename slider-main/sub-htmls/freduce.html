                    In a world where everything is grown with chemicals, where food
                    supply chains are long and food is nutritionally deficient, FREDUCE
                    is restoring what never should have been lost: pure, fresh, and
                    responsibly grown vegetables- delivered within 24 hours of harvest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    FREDUCE, an abbreviation of Fresh Produce, is the new daring
                    solution to a healthy future in India. Our uncompromising attitude
                    to quality, safety, and nutrition is redefining how people get their
                    food, beginning with how it is grown, to how fast it gets to your
                    plate.

                    At FREDUCE, fresh is not a marketing slogan; it is a promise. Our
                    produce is picked and shipped in less than 24 hours, which means
                    minimal nutrient loss, maximum shelf life, and optimum taste.
                    FREDUCE reduces the time it takes to get the product to the shelves
                    by cutting down the farm-to-fork process to less than a day, unlike
                    the traditional supply chains, which take days or even weeks. This
                    fast turnaround time saves:

                    Conventional farming has become rampant with heavy metal

                    These invisible poisons build up unnoticed in the food chain and
                    lead to chronic health problems such as digestive disorders, hormone
                    imbalance, and even cancer.

                    The majority of hydroponic startups pursue exotic greens: lettuce,
                    kale, arugula, and broccoli. Although they have a niche, they seldom
                    reach the Indian kitchen every day. FREDUCE is not that way. We
                    cultivate what India consumes.
                </p>
                <p>We are interested in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sorrel Leaves (Gongura) - a South Indian household staple</li>
                    <li>
                        Cherry tomatoes- they go well with salads and Indian curries
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Amaranthus (Thotakura) - very nutritious and locally popular
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Capsicum (Bell Peppers) - colorful, crispy, and rich in Vitamin C
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Other leafy vegetables, which are the mainstay of Indian cooking
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Spinach (Palak) - iron-rich and can be used in dal, parathas, and

                    This will make us relevant, affordable, and in tandem with the daily

                    supported by the professional advice of qualified dieticians and
                    nutritionists. This implies that our customers eat right and not

                        Dietitians collaborate with families and individuals to develop

                    <li>
                        Nutritional campaigns promote the idea of eating smarter, not
